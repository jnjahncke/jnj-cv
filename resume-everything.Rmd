I hosted a table with two epifluorescent microscopes to show people brain cells in a variety of tissues and staining techniques. We discussed the anatomy of different types of brain cells throughout the brain and how they communicate to one another. -->
<!-- -   During public seminars designed to explore neuroscience in an approachable way I had sheep brains and cow eyes, bisected in multiple ways in order to teach the public about brain and eye anatomy (and how they connect) and general regional function -->
<!-- -   I recruited grad students and undergraduates to help teach passersby about brain anatomy, cell types, comparative anatomy, visual illusions, and more. We also made ourselves available to answer any questions that people might have about the brain. -->

### UC Davis Neurobiology, Physiology, & Behavior Club

Guest Speaker
